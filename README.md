## üå± Development Workflow

- Each task should be developed in a **new branch** based off the `dev` branch using naming conventions:

  - Features ‚Üí `feature/<name>`  
    Example: `feature/flashcard-ui`

  - Bug fixes ‚Üí `fix/<name>`  
    Example: `fix/login-validation`

- Once a task is completed, create a **Pull Request (PR)**.
  - The rest of the team will **test it before merging** into `main`.

## ‚úÖ Contribution Guidelines

1. Always create a **new branch** for each task.
2. Follow the branch naming convention (`feature/*`, `fix/*`).
3. Push your changes and create a **Pull Request**.
4. Wait for teammates to test your PR before merging.
5. Keep commits **clear and descriptive**.
6. Keep `.env.local` and sensitive files out of version control.
